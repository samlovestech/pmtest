# pmtest
R package that implements those modified tests

When dealing with scenarios where some samples from matched pairs design are missing, common statistical tests lack operating characteristics to robustly infer on parameters. The pmtest package provides users with five options when analyzing partially matched samples:

Modified T-Statistic by Kim et al1
Corrected Z-Test by Looney and Jones2
Maximum Likelihood Test by Lin and Stivers3
Maximum Likelihood Test by Ekbohm4
Weighted Z-test by Kuan and Huang5
This document introduces you to situations where you will use these methods, and shows you how to apply them in partially matched samples situations.
